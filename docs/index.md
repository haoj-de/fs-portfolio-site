# Functional Safety × Data Governance Portfolio

I help engineering organizations turn safety and quality evidence into **audit-ready, decision-ready data systems**.

My focus is at the intersection of:

- **Functional Safety** (ISO 26262 mindset, traceability, risk control)
- **Data Governance** (definitions, ownership, controls, quality rules)
- **Analytics Execution** (SQL-driven metrics, release gates, actionable dashboards)

---

## What I Solve

Many teams already have tools (ALM, test management, defect tracking), but still struggle with:

- Inconsistent KPI definitions across teams
- Broken links between requirements, tests, and defects
- Manual, error-prone release reporting
- High audit preparation effort

I design and implement governance-driven analytics that make these processes reproducible and trustworthy.

## Core Value I Deliver

- Unified metric definitions for safety/quality KPIs  
- Data quality controls (completeness, consistency, referential integrity)  
- Traceability coverage and gap detection  
- Automated release-gate logic with clear pass/fail reasons  
- Audit-ready lineage, documentation, and change traceability
