# Reusable Assets

## Why reusable assets matter

Strong Functional Safety execution should not depend on heroic individual effort.  
I build reusable assets to make delivery **repeatable, auditable, and scalable** across teams and projects.

These assets reduce ramp-up time, improve consistency, and lower audit friction.
