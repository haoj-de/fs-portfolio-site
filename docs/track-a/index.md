# Track A — Functional Safety Excellence

This track demonstrates my core Functional Safety capability built through real project delivery from concept to production.

It focuses on four pillars:

- **Safety Lifecycle** (Concept → SOP)
- **Audit / Compliance**
- **Traceability & Metrics**
- **Reusable Assets** (templates, checklists, process maps)

---

## What this track proves

- I can operationalize Functional Safety across lifecycle phases.
- I can prepare and defend audit evidence under pressure.
- I can define and monitor traceability and quality metrics.
- I can build reusable assets that scale across teams.
