# Safety Lifecycle (Concept to SOP)

## Context

I supported Functional Safety activities across the product lifecycle, from early concept to production readiness (SOP), in a multi-disciplinary engineering environment.

- **Domain:** [Automotive / Rail / Industrial]
- **System scope:** [ECU / Platform / Product Line]
- **Standards context:** ISO 26262, [ASPICE / IEC 61508 if applicable]
- **Project period:** [Month YYYY – Month YYYY]

---

## Problem

Teams had strong engineering capabilities, but safety activities were at risk of becoming fragmented across lifecycle phases:

- Safety goals were not always translated consistently into software/system requirements.
- Verification planning and evidence generation were uneven across teams.
- Change impact visibility was limited when requirements evolved.

---

## Actions

I implemented lifecycle controls and alignment mechanisms:

1. Defined and maintained safety work products across phases  
   (Safety Plan, Safety Requirements, verification inputs, evidence structure).

2. Aligned interfaces between system, software, test, and quality teams  
   to ensure consistent safety intent from concept to implementation.

3. Introduced structured review checkpoints for lifecycle milestones  
   (concept sign-off, design readiness, verification readiness, release readiness).

4. Strengthened traceability discipline across requirements, tests, and defects.

## Controls / Method

- Lifecycle governance by phase (entry/exit criteria)
- Review checklists with ownership and due dates
- Requirement quality criteria and review gates
- Evidence packaging for milestone and audit readiness

---

## Results

- Improved lifecycle consistency across teams from **[X]% → [Y]%** (internal KPI/proxy)
- Reduced late-stage rework related to safety artifacts by **[X]%**
- Increased on-time milestone evidence readiness from **[X]% → [Y]%**
- Improved cross-team change-response turnaround from **[X days] → [Y days]**

---

## Artifacts

- Safety lifecycle checklist (phase-based)
- Safety work product map
- Milestone readiness template
- Cross-team review workflow

## Scale this with data

See how lifecycle controls become measurable governance using data quality rules and release-gate analytics.
