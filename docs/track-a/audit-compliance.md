# Audit & Compliance

## Context

I supported internal/external audit readiness by structuring evidence, closing traceability gaps, and coordinating cross-functional remediation.

- **Audit type:** [Internal / External / Customer / Certification-related]
- **Scope:** [Project / Product / Process area]
- **Standard context:** ISO 26262, [ASPICE / IEC 61508 if applicable]

---

## Problem

Audit preparation was effort-intensive and reactive:

- Evidence was scattered across tools and owners.
- Findings often repeated due to unclear closure ownership.
- Traceability proof required manual reconciliation close to audit deadlines.

---

## Actions

1. Built an evidence closure workflow with clear ownership  
   (who provides, who reviews, who approves, by when).

2. Introduced a finding taxonomy and prioritization logic  
   to focus on high-risk/non-conformity items first.

3. Standardized evidence package structure  
   (artifact naming, versioning, acceptance criteria).

4. Established recurring readiness checks before major audit windows.

## Controls / Method

- RACI for audit evidence and finding closure
- Standard checklist for evidence completeness/consistency
- Closure SLA tracking and escalation path
- Re-test/re-review criteria for recurring findings

---

## Results

- Reduced audit preparation lead time from **[X days] → [Y days]**
- Improved first-pass closure rate from **[X]% → [Y]%**
- Reduced repeated findings by **[X]%** across [X] cycles
- Increased on-time evidence submission from **[X]% → [Y]%**

---

## Artifacts

- Audit evidence checklist
- Finding triage and closure tracker
- RACI template for compliance workflows
- Pre-audit readiness review template
