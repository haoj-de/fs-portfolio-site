# Track B — Safety × Data Transformation

This track shows how I extend Functional Safety into data-driven execution.

The goal is to make safety and quality evidence:

- **reproducible**
- **governed**
- **decision-ready**
- **audit-ready**

---

## Focus areas

- **Data Governance for Safety/Quality**
- **Analytics Execution** (SQL metrics, release-gate logic, reporting)
- **Data Quality Controls** (rules, integrity checks, exception handling)
- **Transformation Roadmap** (how to scale from manual to governed analytics)

---

## What this track proves

- I can convert safety practices into structured data controls.
- I can standardize KPI definitions across teams.
- I can automate traceability and release-gate decision support.
- I can align engineering, QA, and compliance stakeholders.
